              <h1>TechCrunch 2017</h1>
              <label>2017/06/21</label>
              <img style="max-width:100%;" src="images/techcrunch17.png" />
              <p>This year showed the first ever TechCrunch in Shenzhen, China. After putting our product forward with a range of other new technologies, our Netvue Belle was chosen as an outstanding new product and earned us a booth
              <p/>
              <h2>What is TechCrunch?</h2>
              <p>We'd be surprised if you haven't seen or heard about a product or tech related news story reported by these guys, they cover pretty much everything from Space exploration to The latest Call of Duty game, if you're not particularly tech savvy you might have come across an article or video without realising from a story about new innovative products or when shopping for a new phone or computer</p>
              <a href="https://techcrunch.com/"></a>
              <h2>Our New Innovative Product</h2>
              <p>On our first day we explored the booth and tried out all the cool gadgets and emmerging technologies (so much VR!). Towards lunchtime we gave a small speech and demonstration of our product, the Netvue Belle, and it's special feature. It's AI user interface.
                <br />
                if you are busy or don't want to be disturbed, leave it to the Netvue X (Our AI computer), your visitors can experience a friendly and direct wifi-doorman to guide them to exactly what it is they need, be it a delivery, a random visit or to call a specific person and given options based on their choice, it even has facial and name recognition so frequent guests can be remembered or given some special priviledges.
                <br /><br />
                We spent a lot of the rest of the day and the next speaking with interested buyers and home security and tech specialists interested in these new areas. We listened to suggestions from potential customers on how they might use our WiFi doorbell and why it could be useful to them, even after development we are always thinking about how our cameras and doorbells can be more relevant and user friendly. This was a really gerat chance to hear from both interested buyers and technology experts for an outside perspective on what will become our flagship product
              </p>
              <h2>To the future</h2>
              <p>Our little Belle has come a long way, and she's not finished yet. There is still a lot of chances for improvement before we take her to release, fall this year she is set to be on sale worldwide, for more information on the Belle and any other of our upcoming or current products please subscribe to our social media feeds
              <br />
              So thanks to everyone who came to see us and we'll see you all again with another new innovation next year.</p>
